# terraform-aws-amplify-app

A Terraform module for building simple Amplify apps.

NOTE: This is currently using [@k24d's Amplify resources](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/6917#issuecomment-626309424) which are still up on PR and not currently merged into the main AWS provider repo. To use this today, you can use [these instructions](https://github.com/k24d/terraform-provider-aws/blob/amplify/README-amplify.md).
